## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ES6
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is the first project that I made in React, so I learned the basics of its syntax, about its components, properties of components, basic use of useState and custom events for setting conditional styling on the mobile menu.

I also learned a bit more about Tailwind CSS, like hover and active states, transform, display and flexbox handles for styles and page layout.

I used also Fontsource to load Inter font.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about how to use React, this time for making reactive changes and for creating views.

on the Tailwind side, I want to know more about animations and transform handles. Also for making more complex UI components that uses some form of logic or conditional styles like the mobile menu that I did.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - The official documentation of Tailwind CSS helped me to know the handles of different style properties and for setting custom or extended styles in its config file.
- [Web fonts with Fontsource](https://lenguajecss.com/css/cargar-tipografias/tipografias-fontsource/) - This tutorial in spanish helped me for setting and loading fonts using Fontsource, which is much more faster than loading from Google Fonts.
